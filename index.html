		<td><h2><I>The Sport of Running</I></h2>
<p>The phrase <I>"I hate running"</I> is a phrase we've all heard very commonly. 
Nobody likes to get up off the couch and take that first step out the door to start a little jog.
Most would rather make a trip to the gym, or hit the elliptical, but would refuse to try to make their body run for more than a couple minutes.</p>
<p>While running may be viewed as a pointess constant struggle, there is far more to running than meets the eye. 
It is often seen as a traditional, easy form of exercise. 
While this can be the case, running is also a way to test physical limits and capacity of mental strength.
<p><I>"How is running a mental sport?"</I>, you may ask.</p>
<p>Running can be seen as the capacity to which you can push your body.
Whether you are participating in a race, or just going for a jog in the neighborhood, you are testing your mind.
As your legs scream at you to stop, and your breathing becomes difficult,
your mind must overpower the negative sensations.
Therefore, running can be seen as a constantly battle between your body and your mind.</p>
<p>Running can be difficult and frustrating, but most people dont know there is a reward.
As you become able to convince your mind that you are capable or running that extra mile,
you become stronger, and find happiness in the challenge. This is where one’s love for running is rooted.</p>

		<td><h2><I>Running and Goal Setting</I></h2>
<p>Goal setting is an extremely important part of running.
Setting a goal may be as small as telling yourself, <I>“I’m going to run 4 miles today”</I> or as large as,
<I>“I’m going to train for months to prepare for a marathon”.</I>
It can even be general by saying <I>“I’m going to start running more”</I>.</p>
<p>It is important to have an idea in your head of what you want to do
so that you can keep yourself accountable and gain a sense of confidence
and accomplishment once you reach your goal.</p>
<p>To reach a long term goal, such as maybe a new <acronym title="Personal Record">PR</acronym> time, you must set up short term goals along the way,
and maybe reward yourself once those smaller goals are completed.
For example, after five days of five solid runs, you reward yourself with an off day.</p>
<p>A goal is something you always keep in the back of your head, and never let 
slip away in order to stay focused.
Sometimes it's good to write down your goals. When you have negative thoughts toward accomplishing your goals, 
write them down too! But then scratch through them. For example:</p>
<div style=border-style:dashed>
<p>Goal: I will complete a half marathon by May.
<del>I'll never be able to run more than 7 miles.</del>
</p>
</div>
<p>Find out what you’re working towards, why you’re working toward it, and the steps to get there.
The pain from the effort is well worth it for the reward.</p>
<p>A quote that I feel directly applies to running is:
<br><I>“When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breath, then you’ll be successful".</I></p>
